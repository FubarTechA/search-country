## Overview

This is a project that allows users to view all countries and also see countries based on regons. users can also click on countries and see more information about that country. it was created with html css and javascript

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

it is always interesting working with apis. my first time adding spinners to sites and i also implemented some error handling on the async functions

### Continued development

Looking forward to working with more apis and hopefully get to build some of my own. i would love to improve my coding practices as majority of my functions were just scattered and not well documented
